## Chat Interacts

### Goals:
Design a twitch chat bot to allow viewers to interact with the game they're watching. The first game for this prototype is a game being developed by the same developer: BandsWithLegends.

### Installation: 
Currently, this bot will only be available in BandsWithLegends' channel, as it does not send the information anywhere and hasn't reached full functionality.

### Roadmap:
 1. Full functionality - Allowing the chat bot to get as far as possible to send a JSON packet of data to Plot Twist
 2. Design a robust user input through chat. I predict a lot of viewer frustration not knowing where they are in the process.
 3. Move to an Extension. It would be easier for a user to use a graphical interface for this type of design, instead of cryptic whispers from a bot.
