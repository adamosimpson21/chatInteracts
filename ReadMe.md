## Chat Interacts

### Goals
Design a twitch chat bot to allow viewers to interact with the game they're watching. The first game for this prototype is a game being developed by the same developer: BandsWithLegends.

### Installation
Currently, this bot will only be available in BandsWithLegends' channel, as it does not send the information anywhere and hasn't reached full functionality.

### Development
If you'd like to contribute to this project, please do! There are a list of roadmap objectives below, and any or all of them are within scope. There are many other small achievements for the bot. If you'd like more information, please contact @BandsWithLegend on twitter or github. 

To get the bot working on your machine, you need your own twitch bot to use with it. You will need a .env file with a `PASSWORD=oauth:yourpasswordhere`. Replace the username in index.js with your bot's name. 

### Roadmap
 1. Full functionality - Allowing the chat bot to get as far as possible to send a JSON packet of data to Plot Twist
 2. Design a robust user input through chat. I predict a lot of viewer frustration not knowing where they are in the process.
 3. Move to an Extension. It would be easier for a user to use a graphical interface for this type of design, instead of cryptic whispers from a bot.
 4. Expand capabilities to other games. This would require a solid amount of engineering on both sides, but is reasonable with a large enough development infrastructure.
